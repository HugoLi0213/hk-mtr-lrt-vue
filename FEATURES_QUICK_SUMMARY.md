## 🤔 What Should We Do?

Tell me which option you prefer:

1. **Add features first** (make it better), then convert to APK
2. **Convert to APK first** (make it mobile), then add features
3. **Just add 1-2 quick features** (fastest improvement)

I recommend: **Add Service Alerts + Fare Calculator**, then convert to APK.

This gives you competitive features in ~5 days, then we make it a native app!
